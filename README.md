## Ideas

- Automatically create stash channels for user once they receive a certain rank (5?). By default do the SFW one but if they have the NSFW role then create an NSFW stash for them as well
- Command to get the direct links to a given users stash so you don't have to scroll through the channel list to find it
- Automatically delete stash channels when:
  - A user gets banned
  - A user leaves the server. If there are less than (30?) messages in the channel then delete it after 24 hours if they do not rejoin. If there are more messages than that, delete the channel if the user does not rejoin after 7 days.
- Admin command to check all the channels and purge any ones that meet the deletion criteria
- Admin command to create a stash for a user if the channels do not exist
